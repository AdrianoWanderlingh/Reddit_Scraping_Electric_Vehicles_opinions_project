The ranges of EVs are nowadays up in a range I'm more-or-less comfortable with, but charging would be a definite issue for me; my parking spot isn't so far from my balcony that I couldn't find a cord that would reach (probably) but I suspect that I'd be breaking bylaws either by having something like that hanging off, or by having it run across the grass and sidewalk on the way to the car, or both.

The nissan EV became the cheapest used EV (you could get them for $3k at one point) because the battery was toast after just 5 years of use....but the technology has come a long way (and the nissans was total crap when new anyway) and most cars at 10 years old start to need some major work done, factoring in the ongoing maintenance costs of an ICE even with a totally new battery you would potentially be better off in many cases.


You have to remember to compare like for like too. A tesla p100d needs to be compared with top level cars, and maintaining your AMG65 or M5 for 10 years almost buys you a new model 3 on its own, if not a couple years old p260d or whatever they will have then.
